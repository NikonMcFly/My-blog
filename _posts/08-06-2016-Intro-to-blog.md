These blog post will be about what I have been learning these passed two years about programming and the challenges I have faced. I will mostly be talking about Javascript (Front-end) such as Angular 1.0 and ReactJS. These post will also contain Golang and my journey of learning back-end myself.

Hopefully, I help teach others and make a few Youtube videos about how these technologies and how APIs are connected to both frontend and backend. 

If you have any feedback or problems about what you see or if I need to improve on something email or tweet at me thanks!
